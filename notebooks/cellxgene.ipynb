    "### Gene Correlation Matrix: Analyzing Expression Data in AnnData Format\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to download and analyze gene expression data in AnnData format based on a specified tissue or cell type. It filters out genes with zero expression values and computes a correlation matrix for a specified gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open and Query Data:**\n",
    "   - Access gene expression data using `cellxgene_census.open_soma()`.\n",
    "   - Query data for 'Homo sapiens' and filter by cell type ('adipocyte') or tissue type ('Adipose').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter Genes:**\n",
    "   - Set gene names (`adata.var['feature_id']`).\n",
    "   - Filter out genes with zero expression values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convert to DataFrame:**\n",
    "   - Convert the filtered expression data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filter Samples:**\n",
    "   - Remove samples where the gene of interest has zero expression.\n",
    "   - Print the percentage of samples with non-zero expression for the gene of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate Correlations:**\n",
    "   - Compute Pearson correlation coefficients for the gene of interest.\n",
    "   - Return and print the top 500 most positively and negatively correlated genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the `cell_type`, `tissue_type`, and `gene_of_interest` variables as needed.\n",
    "- Use `get_coexpression_matrix(gene, tissue, cell_type, k=500)` to obtain top correlated genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure access to the appropriate AnnData formatted dataset.\n",
    "- Experiment with different parameters to explore gene expression correlations.\n"
